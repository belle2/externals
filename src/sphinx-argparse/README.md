Changelog & contributors
========================

0.2.0
-----

- Section titles can now be used in tables of contents and linked to. The title itself is also used as the anchor. In the case of repeated names `_replicateX`, where `X` is a number, is prepended to ensure that all titles are uniquely linkable. This was bug #46.

0.1.17
------

- Fixed handling of argument groups (this was bug #49). Thanks to @croth1 for reporting this bug. Note that now position arguments (also known as required arguments) within argument groups are now also handled correctly.

0.1.16
------

- Added a `:nodefaultconst:` directive, which is similar to the `:nodefault:` directive, but applies only to `store_true`, `store_false`, and `store_const` (e.g., it will hide the "=True" part in the output, since that can be misleading to users).
- Fixed various typos (thanks to users mikeantonacci, brondsem, and tony)
- Format specifiers (e.g., `%(prog)s` and `%(default)s`) are now filled in (if possible) in help sections. If there's a missing keyword, then nothing will be filled in. This was issue #27.
- The package is now a bit more robust to incorrectly spelling module names (#39, courtesy of Gabriel Falc√£o)
- Added support for argparse groups (thanks to Fidel Ramirez)
